#Hierarchical Layout Sample

This sample shows how to arrange the nodes in an hierarchical structure. The hierarchical tree layout arranges nodes in a tree-like structure, where the nodes in the hierarchical layout may have multiple parents. There is no need to specify the layout root. To arrange the nodes in an hierarchical structure, specify the layout Type as HierarchicalTree.
