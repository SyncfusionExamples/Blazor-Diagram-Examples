# GraphQLAdaptor-Binding-Blazor-Diagram

GraphQL is a query language for APIs with which you can get exactly what you need and nothing more. The GraphQLAdaptor provides an option to retrieve data from the GraphQL server.

## Steps to run the project

1. First run the ASPNetCoreGraphQlServer application which is the GraphQL server.
2. Now run the BlazorApplication in which data is bounded to the diagram component by using the DataManager's GraphQL adaptor.

Please see the output image below.
