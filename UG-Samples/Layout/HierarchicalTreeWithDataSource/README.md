#Hierarchical Layout Sample

This sample shows how to arrange the nodes in a hierarchical structure. The hierarchical tree layout arranges nodes in a tree-like structure, where the nodes in the hierarchical layout may have multiple parents. There is no need to specify the layout root. To arrange the nodes in a hierarchical structure, specify the layout Type as HierarchicalTree.
