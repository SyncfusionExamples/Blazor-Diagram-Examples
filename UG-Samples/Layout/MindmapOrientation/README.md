#Mindmap Orienation Sample

This sample demonstrates how to change the orientation of a mind map layout in a diagram. A mind map visually organizes information around a central concept, displaying nodes in a spider-like structure. You can customize the spacing between nodes using the layout's horizontal and vertical spacing properties. The orientation property allows you to adjust the direction in which the mind map branches are arranged. Additionally, the info property can be used to further customize the tree structure of
of the mind map.
